3. **Cornell ML Foundation Project: Airbnb Analysis**  
   - **Description:** For the final project in the Cornell Machine Learning Foundation course, I analyzed Airbnb listing descriptions to identify common words and themes that contribute to the success of listings. The goal was to understand the key characteristics of successful listings using NLP techniques.
   - **Role:** Solo Project
      - Preprocessed the data by handling missing values and cleaning text using regular expressions, NLTK, and Gensim.
      - Applied Word2Vec to create word embeddings of Airbnb listing descriptions.
      - Used K-means clustering to group similar word embeddings and identify common themes.
      - Evaluated model results using subjective approaches due to dataset constraints and limited NLP methods learned in the course.
